Monkeytyper

A common philosophical claim is that an infinite number of monkeys, typing at an infinite number of typewriters will, eventually, produce every interesting text, including the complete works of Shakespear, interesting treatisies on science and invention, and any other text a person might be interested in.

The monkey in question is not a literal monkey as such, as when a zoo actually did attempt this in the literal, the monkeys hit the "s" key a number of times and also soiled it with waste.   No, this monkey-typewriter system is a generator of purely random text, which understands precisely none of the gibberish it spews forth.   This program impliements the philosophical moneky in a very concise way.
